# Combining Scala and Java

Since Scala is highly compatible with Java, most of the time you can combine the languages without worrying very much.
Nonetheless, from time to time, you will run into some issues combining Java and Scala.

Scala is implemented as a translation to standard Java bytecodes.

### Value types

### Singleton objects

### Traits as interfaces

Compiling any trait creates a Java interface of the same name.
