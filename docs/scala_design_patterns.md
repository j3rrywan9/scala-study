# Scala Design Patterns

## Preface

Using Scala to its full potential, however, requires us to be familiar with not only the object-oriented features, but also with the functional ones.

The fact that Scala is close to object-oriented languages means that many of the design patterns for object-oriented programming are still applicable here.
The fact that it is also functional means that some other design patterns are also applicable, and some of the object-oriented ones could be modified to better fit the paradigm of Scala.
